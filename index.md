# Introduction

Hello ! I am Chaitanya (pronounciation [help](https://pronouncenames.com/search?name=chaitanya))  an Applied Scientist with [Amazon Comprehend Medical](https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/medical/). I work on applying machine learning and natural language processing to biomedical data.

Before joining Amazon, I was a Research Staff Member with IBM Research at the [beautiful](https://flic.kr/p/e9D4tp) [Almaden laboratory](http://www.research.ibm.com/labs/almaden/). I [worked](./at_ibm.html) on multi-modal problems applying machine learning, NLP and computer vision to radiology data. 

I was a PhD student at the Speech and Language Processing ([SLaTe](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/slate/about.html)) lab in Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Ohio State. I was advised by [Eric Fosler-Lussier](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~fosler-lussier.1/) and [Albert Lai](https://informatics.wustl.edu/research-lab-albert-lai/). My dissertation research explored using NLP and machine learning for expediting clinical trial recruitment.

Before starting grad school, I spent two wonderful years as a researcher at the [Tata Research Development and Design Center](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tata_Research_Development_and_Design_Centre). I was a part of the systems research laboratory and worked on optimization of data centers.
