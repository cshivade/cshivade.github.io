## Work at IBM Research
I was at the [beautiful](https://flic.kr/p/e9D4tp) [Almaden laboratory](http://www.research.ibm.com/labs/almaden/) in San Jose, California. Following are a few selected projects during my time at IBM Research.

### Research

<dl>
<dt> Natural Language Inference in Medicine </dt>
<dd> We curated a dataset for natural language inference in medicine and made it publicly available. Our proposed models explore combining structured knowledge sources with deep learning models.</dd>
