## At Ohio State
I was a PhD student at the Speech and Language Processing ([SLaTe](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/slate/about.html)) lab. I was advised by [Eric Fosler-Lussier](http://web.cse.ohio-state.edu/~fosler-lussier.1/) and [Albert Lai](https://informatics.wustl.edu/research-lab-albert-lai/). My research was interdisciplanry involving collaboration with colleagues from deparments at Computer Science, Lingusitics, and Biomedical Informatics. I was a member of the Computational Lingusitics and Language Technology ([CLLT](https://u.osu.edu/cllt/)) group.
